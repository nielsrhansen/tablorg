Title: Table organization of computations
Version: 0.1
Authors@R: person("Niels Richard", "Hansen", email = "Niels.R.Hansen@math.ku.dk", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: 
  Tools for organizing results from R computations. Overview and easy access 
  to the results are provided via an HTML table. This is a light weight alternative 
  to an actual database. The tools are useful when running many analyses or simulations
  with varying parameter settings. The results are organized in directories 
  and accessed through an HTML table via a web server. This gives an R independent
  way of monitoring computations running e.g. as an R batch script either 
  locally or on a remote server.
